## About Me

I am a Ph.D student in Economics at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.  

Broadly speaking, my research focuses on the role of imperfect information in macroeconomic business cycles. I am also interested in heterogeneous agent models. My current work explores topics such as the signaling effects of policy news and house price dynamics.
