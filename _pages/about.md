I am currently an undergraduate student at Peking University, applying for PhD programs in Economics. Broadly speaking, my research focuses on the role of imperfect information in macroeconomic business cycles. I am also interested in heterogeneous agent models. My current work explores topics such as the signaling effects of policy news and house price dynamics.
