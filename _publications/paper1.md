I establish a DSGE model with incomplete information and endogenous policy signals. The core mechanism is a stimulus policy-pessimism feedback loop: stimulus policy signals trigger rational pessimism by informing people that the government views the economy as being in recession and in need of stimulus. Feedback like that will weaken the effectiveness of stimulus policy and exacerbates the recession.
